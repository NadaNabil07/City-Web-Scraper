This script extracts city information from a webpage using Python, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup.

## Overview

The web scraping script is designed to extract city names from the webpage "https://www.bezorgdekrant.nl/en/all-jobs". It utilizes the Selenium library to open a Chrome browser, waits for dynamic content to load, and then uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and extract city names.
